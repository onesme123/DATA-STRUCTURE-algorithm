Why stack is powerful for reversing?
A stack uses Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.
When you push elements in order, the last element goes on top.
When you pop, you get the last element first.
This naturally reverses the order of items without extra loops.
Example: pushing letters of a word then popping outputs them reversed.
4.Reflection: Why stack is powerful for reversing?
•	A stack works on Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) order.
•	When you push items in one sequence and pop them out, the order is reversed automatically.
•	This is why stacks are ideal for undo actions, backtracking, reversing strings, etc



QUENE QUESTIONS:
3.Reflection: Why FIFO matters in classrooms?
•	FIFO (First In, First Out) ensures fairness and discipline.
•	Students who come early are attended first — prevents crowding and complaints.
•	It mirrors how service lines work in banks, hospitals, or ticketing.
